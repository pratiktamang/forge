# TODO

## High Priority


## Features

- [ ] Keyboard navigation improvements across the app
- [ ] Global hotkeys for quick capture

## Low Priority

## Vim Mode Polish
The basic vim functionality is implemented but needs refinement:
- [ ] Smoother cursor movement (feels clunky)
- [ ] Better visual feedback during operations
- [ ] Fix edge cases in motions (word boundaries, line ends)
- [ ] Text objects need work (iw, aw, i", etc.)
- [ ] Dot repeat (.) needs to capture full operation sequences
- [ ] Search with `/` and `?` not fully working
- [ ] Undo granularity (currently uses native undo which groups too much)
- [ ] Block cursor rendering improvements
- [ ] Status line updates feel laggy
